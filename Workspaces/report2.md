## Report on Long-Term Trends in Ocean Acidification in the North Atlantic

### 1. Introduction

Ocean acidification (OA) refers to the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused primarily by the absorption of excess atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activities. The North Atlantic, a region of significant oceanic circulation and biological productivity, is particularly susceptible to these changes due to its cold waters, which enhance CO2 solubility, and its role in the global overturning circulation. This report synthesizes key findings on the long-term trends of ocean acidification in the North Atlantic, examines the relationship between pH and salinity, and outlines the observed and projected impacts on marine ecosystems, along with monitoring, mitigation, and socio-economic considerations.

### 2. Key Findings Summary

*   **Significant pH Decline:** The North Atlantic has experienced a substantial decrease in pH since the pre-industrial era, with current rates of acidification among the highest globally.
*   **CO2 Absorption:** The North Atlantic is a major sink for anthropogenic CO2, leading to increased dissolved inorganic carbon and reduced carbonate ion concentrations.
*   **pH-Salinity Relationship:** Salinity variations, influenced by freshwater inputs, can locally modulate pH. Lower salinity waters generally have lower buffering capacity, making them more vulnerable to acidification.
*   **Ecosystem Vulnerability:** Calcifying organisms (e.g., shellfish, corals, pteropods) are particularly vulnerable, facing challenges in shell/skeleton formation, with cascading effects on food webs.
*   **Future Projections:** Climate models project continued and accelerated acidification under various emission scenarios, with potential for severe impacts on marine life and ecosystem services.
*   **Monitoring Challenges:** Long-term, high-resolution monitoring is crucial but faces challenges in data consistency, spatial coverage, and technological limitations.
*   **Socio-Economic Impacts:** Fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism sectors in the North Atlantic face significant economic losses and social disruptions due to OA impacts on marine resources.

### 3. Historical Overview of Ocean Acidification in the North Atlantic

The historical context of ocean acidification in the North Atlantic is intrinsically linked to the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the Industrial Revolution.

*   **Pre-industrial CO2 Levels:** Prior to industrialization, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were approximately 280 parts per million (ppm). Ocean pH was relatively stable, estimated to be around 8.2 (NOAA, 2024).
*   **Early pH Measurement Techniques:** Early measurements of ocean pH were less precise than modern methods. Historically, pH was often inferred from alkalinity and CO2 measurements, or measured using less accurate colorimetric methods or glass electrodes that were prone to drift and temperature sensitivity (Riebesell et al., 2010). Direct, high-precision pH measurements across broad oceanic regions only became widespread in the latter half of the 20th century.
*   **Historical CO2 Emission Sources:** The primary historical CO2 emission sources influencing the North Atlantic, and global oceans, include the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) for energy, industrial processes, and land-use changes such as deforestation (IPCC, 2021).
*   **Impact of Industrialization:** Industrialization led to a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2, which subsequently increased the absorption of CO2 by the North Atlantic. This absorption initiates chemical reactions in seawater, forming carbonic acid and leading to a decrease in pH and a reduction in the concentration of carbonate ions (CO3^2-), which are vital for calcifying organisms (Doney et al., 2009). The North Atlantic has absorbed a significant portion of anthropogenic CO2, making it one of the most rapidly acidifying ocean basins (Olsen et al., 2020).
*   **Limitations of Early Data:** Early data suffered from limited spatial and temporal coverage, varying measurement techniques, and less sophisticated instrumentation, making it challenging to establish precise pre-industrial baselines and accurately track initial acidification rates. However, proxy records from marine sediments and corals provide valuable insights into past ocean chemistry (Feely et al., 2004).

### 4. Current State of Ocean Acidification: pH and CO2 Levels

The North Atlantic continues to experience significant ocean acidification, with observable changes in pH and CO2 concentrations.

*   **Recent pH Measurements:** Current pH levels in the North Atlantic have decreased by approximately 0.1 to 0.2 units since the pre-industrial era (IPCC, 2021). This seemingly small change represents a roughly 30% increase in ocean acidity due to the logarithmic nature of the pH scale (NOAA, 2024). Specific long-term monitoring sites, such as the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) and the European Station for Time-series in the Ocean, Canary Islands (ESTOC), show consistent declines in surface ocean pH (Bates et al., 2014; González-Dávila et al., 2010).
*   **CO2 Concentration Data:** The North Atlantic is a major sink for anthropogenic CO2, absorbing a substantial amount of atmospheric CO2. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations have increased, leading to a corresponding decrease in carbonate ion concentrations and saturation states of aragonite and calcite, which are forms of calcium carbonate essential for marine organisms (Tanhua et al., 2015).
*   **Spatial Distribution Maps:** Acidification is not uniform across the North Atlantic. High-latitude regions, such as the subpolar North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean, are particularly vulnerable due to colder waters enhancing CO2 solubility and freshwater inputs from ice melt. Coastal areas, influenced by riverine inputs and local biogeochemical processes, can also exhibit distinct acidification patterns (Azetsu-Scott et al., 2010). Deep waters of the North Atlantic, formed by the sinking of cold, CO2-rich surface waters, also show signs of acidification (Perez et al., 2010).
*   **Rate of Acidification:** The rate of pH decline in the North Atlantic is estimated to be around 0.0017 to 0.0024 pH units per year in some regions, which is faster than the global average in certain areas, particularly the subpolar gyre (Lauvset et al., 2015).
*   **Seasonal Variations:** Seasonal variations in biological activity (photosynthesis and respiration), temperature, and ocean circulation can influence local CO2 and pH levels. During spring and summer, increased primary productivity can temporarily reduce CO2 and increase pH in surface waters. Conversely, during winter, colder temperatures and reduced biological uptake lead to higher CO2 solubility and lower pH (Bates et 2014).

### 5. Relationship between pH and Salinity in the North Atlantic

The relationship between pH and salinity in the North Atlantic is complex, with salinity variations influencing the buffering capacity of seawater and its ability to absorb CO2.

*   **Salinity Data Analysis:** Salinity in the North Atlantic varies geographically and seasonally, influenced by evaporation, precipitation, riverine runoff, and ice melt. Generally, higher salinity waters tend to have a greater buffering capacity due to higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity (Frankignoul & Hasselmann, 1977).
*   **Buffering Capacity:** Seawater's buffering capacity refers to its ability to resist changes in pH when acids or bases are added. This capacity is primarily determined by the carbonate system (bicarbonate and carbonate ions). Higher alkalinity, often correlated with higher salinity in open ocean settings, provides a stronger buffer against pH changes (Zeebe & Wolf-Gladrow, 2001). However, in coastal regions or areas with significant freshwater input, this relationship can be altered.
*   **Freshwater Input Effects:** Freshwater inputs from rivers (e.g., St. Lawrence River, European rivers) and melting ice (e.g., Greenland Ice Sheet) can significantly impact the pH-salinity relationship. Freshwater generally has lower alkalinity and CO2 concentrations than seawater. When mixed with seawater, it can dilute the buffering capacity, making these regions more susceptible to acidification, even if the absolute pH might appear higher initially due to lower initial CO2 (Azetsu-Scott et al., 2010). This can create localized "hotspots" of vulnerability.
*   **Regional Variations:**
    *   **Coastal Zones:** In estuaries and coastal areas, freshwater runoff and nutrient loading can lead to lower salinity and reduced buffering capacity, exacerbating acidification effects (Wallace et al., 2014).
    *   **Arctic and Subarctic Regions:** Melting sea ice and glacial runoff introduce large volumes of low-alkalinity freshwater, which can locally reduce salinity and buffering capacity, making these areas particularly sensitive to ocean acidification (Azetsu-Scott et al., 2010).
    *   **Open Ocean:** In the open North Atlantic, where freshwater inputs are less dominant, the pH-salinity relationship is more stable, primarily driven by the uptake of atmospheric CO2 and ocean circulation patterns.
*   **Statistical Correlation Analysis:** Studies have shown that while there is a general inverse relationship between increasing CO2 and decreasing pH, the correlation between pH and salinity can be variable. In some regions, a strong inverse correlation exists where lower salinity corresponds to lower alkalinity and thus lower pH buffering capacity. However, in other areas, local biogeochemical processes can decouple this relationship, making it non-linear (Wallace et al., 2014). For instance, high biological productivity in some lower salinity regions can temporarily increase pH.

### 6. Impact of Ocean Acidification on Marine Ecosystems

Ocean acidification in the North Atlantic poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems, particularly affecting calcifying organisms and leading to cascading effects throughout the food web.

*   **Shellfish Calcification:** Bivalves such as mussels, oysters, and scallops, which are economically important in the North Atlantic, rely on calcium carbonate to build their shells. Reduced carbonate ion availability due to acidification makes shell formation energetically more costly and can lead to thinner, weaker shells, increased mortality, and reduced growth rates, especially during larval stages (Gazeau et al., 2013). Studies have shown significant impacts on the calcification rates of commercially important species like the blue mussel (*Mytilus edulis*) and the Atlantic surfclam (*Spisula solidissima*) (Talmage & Gobler, 2011).
*   **Coral Reef Impacts:** While tropical coral reefs are often highlighted, cold-water corals (CWC) are prevalent in the deep North Atlantic, forming important habitats. These corals, such as *Lophelia pertusa*, are highly vulnerable to decreasing aragonite saturation states. Acidification can inhibit their calcification, reduce growth rates, and lead to dissolution of existing skeletons, threatening the structural integrity of these vital deep-sea ecosystems (Roberts et al., 2009).
*   **Plankton Responses:**
    *   **Pteropods:** These "sea butterflies" are small, calcifying plankton that form a crucial part of the North Atlantic food web. Their aragonite shells are highly sensitive to reduced pH and aragonite saturation, with observations of shell dissolution in acidified waters (Bednaršek et al., 2014).
    *   **Coccolithophores:** These phytoplankton produce calcium carbonate plates (coccoliths). While some species may be negatively affected, others might show resilience or even thrive under elevated CO2, but overall community shifts could have implications for carbon cycling (Riebesell et al., 2000).
    *   **Zooplankton:** Changes in phytoplankton communities can alter the food quality for zooplankton, affecting their growth and reproduction.
*   **Food Web Disruptions:** Impacts on foundational species like pteropods and calcifying plankton can have cascading effects throughout the North Atlantic food web. Organisms that feed on these vulnerable species, including fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, may experience reduced food availability, affecting their growth, reproduction, and survival (Kroeker et al., 2013). This can lead to shifts in species distribution and abundance.
*   **Ecosystem-level Effects:** The cumulative impacts of ocean acidification, often in combination with other stressors like warming, deoxygenation, and pollution, can lead to significant ecosystem-level changes. These include altered biodiversity, reduced ecosystem resilience, and potential shifts in dominant species, ultimately affecting the overall health and functioning of North Atlantic marine ecosystems (Doney et al., 2009).

### 7. Future Projections of Ocean Acidification in the North Atlantic

Future projections for ocean acidification in the North Atlantic, based on climate models and emission scenarios, indicate a continued and accelerated decline in pH with significant ecological consequences.

*   **Climate Model Outputs:** Earth system models consistently project a substantial decrease in ocean pH globally, and particularly in the North Atlantic, under various future CO2 emission scenarios (IPCC, 2021). These models integrate complex interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice.
*   **RCP Scenarios:** Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are scenarios that describe different possible climate futures, depending on the extent of greenhouse gas emissions.
    *   **RCP2.6 (Low Emissions):** Even under a low-emission scenario, the North Atlantic is projected to experience further pH declines, though at a slower rate, potentially reaching a pH reduction of 0.1 to 0.2 units by 2100 relative to present-day levels (Bopp et al., 2013).
    *   **RCP8.5 (High Emissions):** Under a high-emission "business-as-usual" scenario, the North Atlantic could see a further pH drop of 0.3 to 0.4 units by 2100, leading to widespread undersaturation of aragonite in surface waters, particularly in high-latitude regions (Bopp et al., 2013; IPCC, 2021). This would represent an unprecedented rate of change in ocean chemistry.
*   **Future pH Projections:** By the end of the 21st century, surface ocean pH in the North Atlantic is projected to decrease by an additional 0.1 to 0.4 pH units, depending on the emission pathway (IPCC, 2021). This would push many regions into conditions where calcifying organisms face severe challenges for survival and growth.
*   **Hotspot Identification:** Future acidification hotspots in the North Atlantic are projected to include the subpolar gyre, the Arctic Ocean, and certain coastal upwelling regions. These areas are characterized by colder waters (enhancing CO2 solubility), strong ocean circulation patterns, and potential freshwater inputs, which collectively accelerate acidification (Azetsu-Scott et al., 2010; IPCC, 2021). Deep-water formation regions are also projected to see significant changes as acidified surface waters sink.
*   **Uncertainty Analysis:** While the overall trend of acidification is robust, uncertainties exist in the precise magnitude and regional distribution of future pH changes. These uncertainties stem from:
    *   **Emission Scenarios:** The largest uncertainty comes from future anthropogenic CO2 emission pathways.
    *   **Carbon Cycle Feedbacks:** The response of natural carbon sinks (land and ocean) to climate change, including potential feedback mechanisms (e.g., changes in ocean circulation, biological productivity), can influence CO2 uptake.
    *   **Model Resolution and Parameterization:** Limitations in climate model resolution and the parameterization of small-scale processes introduce uncertainties in regional projections.
    *   **Combined Stressors:** The interaction of acidification with other stressors like ocean warming, deoxygenation, and pollution adds complexity and uncertainty to projections of ecosystem impacts (Boyd et al., 2020).

### 8. Monitoring and Data Collection Methods for Ocean Acidification

Effective monitoring of ocean acidification in the North Atlantic requires a combination of advanced technologies and coordinated international efforts to track changes in ocean chemistry.

*   **pH Sensor Technologies:**
    *   **Glass Electrodes:** Traditional and widely used for discrete measurements, but require frequent calibration and can be prone to drift in long-term deployments
